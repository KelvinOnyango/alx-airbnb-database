# Query Optimization Report

## Initial Query Analysis
**Query:** Retrieves all bookings with user, property, and payment details  
**Execution Plan Highlights:**
- Sequential scans on large tables
- Hash joins consuming significant memory
- No predicate pushdown or early filtering
- Retrieving all columns from all tables unnecessarily

**Performance Issues Identified:**
1. Full table scans due to missing indexes on join columns
2. Fetching all columns when only specific ones are needed
3. No date filtering on bookings table
4. No partitioning of large tables

## Optimization Strategies Applied

### 1. Column Selection Optimization
- Selected only necessary columns from each table
- Used subqueries to limit columns fetched early in execution

### 2. Join Optimization
- Ensured all join columns are properly indexed
- Changed join order based on table sizes

### 3. Filter Predicate Addition
- Added date range filter to reduce booking rows processed
- `WHERE b.start_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'`

### 4. Index Utilization
- Verified indexes exist on:
  - `bookings(user_id, property_id)`
  - `payments(booking_id)`
  - `users(user_id)`
  - `properties(property_id)`
